# Third Homework
----------------
## There is my implementations of the linear, Lagrange, spline interpolation**

**Train**

Linear and Lagrange interpolation are trained on the grid x, y which are located in the "train" folder under the name "train.dat" and "train.ans" respectively. Since spline interpolation in my interpretation requires a uniform grid, for this I created a separate folder "train_for_spline_interpolation".

**FILL WITH RANDOM DATA**

To automate the filling of the grid for training and the grid for checking interpolation, I wrote the program __fill_with_random_data.ipynb__
