# First Homework
----------------
## the first task is my implementation of the Gaus method
The following five graphs compare the _calculation accuracy_ of my implementation of the Gaus method with the library __numpy.linalg.solve()__ for a matrix of dimensions 100x100, 200x200, 300x300, 400x400, 500x500.

And this graph shows the dependence of the execution time on the dimension of the matrix. As you can see, the graph is similar to ___n^3___, which corresponds to the _complexity of the algorithm_.

## the second task is my implementation of the Cholesky method
## the third task is my implementation of the sweep method
