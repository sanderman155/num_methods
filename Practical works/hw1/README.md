# First Homework
----------------
## the first task is my implementation of the Gaus method
The following five graphs compare the calculation accuracy of my implementation of the Gaus method with the library numpy.linalg.solve() for a matrix of dimensions 100x100, 200x200, 300x300, 400x400, 500x500.
